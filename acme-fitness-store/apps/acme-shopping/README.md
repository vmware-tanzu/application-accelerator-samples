This fork is for demonstrating [Spring Cloud Gateway for kubernetes](https://docs.pivotal.io/scg-k8s/1-0/installation.html). Compared to the original repo, this fork doesn't have the node backend or anything dynamic. It's merely a static frontend app that relies on Spring Cloud Gateway to proxy all the outbound requests. The modified images is published at: [springcloudservices/fitness-frontend](https://hub.docker.com/r/springcloudservices/fitness-frontend).

> A front-end service, because how can you shop without seeing?

The Front-End service is part of the [ACME Fitness Shop](https://github.com/vmwarecloudadvocacy/acme_fitness_demo). The goal of this specific service is to serve as the front-end that presents the content.

## Prerequisites

There are different dependencies based on whether you want to run a built container, or build a new one.

### Build

* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/docker-community)

### Run
