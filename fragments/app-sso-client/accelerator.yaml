              ## Resources needed for AppSSO integration

              Please first familiarize yourself with basic concepts around using AppSSO to secure your workload on TAP following 
              [AppSSO''s documentation](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Tanzu-Application-Platform/1.6/tap/app-sso-about.html)
              .

              This repository includes an integration to set up an authentication mechanism with AppSSO.

              ## Getting Started

              1. Discover your `AppSSO` service offerings

                 ```bash
                 tanzu services classes list
                 ```

                 If there isn''t one,

                   - ask your service operator `OR`
                   - [create your own `ClusterUnsafeTestLogin`](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Tanzu-Application-Platform/1.6/tap/app-sso-reference-api-clusterunsafetestlogin.html)

              2. Select the service offering you''d like to connect

              4. Claim an instance from the offering

                 ```bash
                 tanzu services class-claims create <your-workload> \\
                   --class <your-selected-appsso-offering> \\
                   --parameter workloadRef.name=<your-workload> \\
                   --parameter redirectPaths=''["/login/oauth2/code/<your-workload>"]''
                 ```

              5. Apply your workload

                 ```bash
                 tanzu apps workload apply \\
                   --file config/workload.yaml \\
                   --namespace <namespace> \\
                   --yes \\
                   --tail
                 ```
              '
        - type: ReplaceText
          substitutions:
            - text: "<your-workload>"
              with: "#workloadName"
            - text: "<your-selected-appsso-offering>"
              with: "#appssoOfferingName"
