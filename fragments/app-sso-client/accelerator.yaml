              ## Resources needed for AppSSO integration
              
              Please first familiarize yourself with basic concepts around using AppSSO to secure your workload on TAP following 
              ["Securing your first Workload" tutorial](https://docs.vmware.com/en/Application-Single-Sign-On-for-VMware-Tanzu/1.0/appsso/GUID-app-operators-tutorials-index.html)
              .
  
              As stated in the mentioned above tutorial a ClientRegistration custom resource definition is a starting point of
              an AppSSO integration. There is a `client-registration.yaml` file generated in the `config` directory. You can
              deploy it applying following command in your project root directory.
              
              ```bash
              \$ kubectl apply -f config/client-registration.yaml
              ```
              
              The next step is to deploy a ResourceClaim which will be used to bind your workload with previously
              created ClientRegistration. There is a correct `client-registration-claim.yaml` file generated for you
              in the `config` directory. It can be used to deploy this ResourceClaim.
              
              ```bash
              \$ kubectl apply -f config/client-registration-claim.yaml
              ```
              
              Now you are ready to deploy your Workload with an AppSSO integration. Your `workload.yaml` is already prepared
              and it includes a service claim referencing the ResourceClaim you created before.
