# Introduction java-server-side-ui
java-server-side-ui provides you an out-of-the-box application setup to fast start development of a Web Application based
on a service side rendering architecture.

It is leveraging Spring Boot as a technology stack, which provides:
- a way to implement Model, View and Controller(s) using Spring Web annotations and Thymeleaf template engine
- an Inversion of Control Container to wire together your classes at running without the need to write tightly-coupled code
- an integrated Web Server, so no need to deploy the built artifact to a separate running web or application server

The application contains example code to have a first public page. This page is built using 
Thymeleaf and WebJars, so that common web libraries are available without the need to copy and paste them in the `resources/static` folder.

It provides a way to test the controller logic.

## Prerequisites
In order to further develop this application the following tools needs to be setup:
- Java Development Kit (https://bell-sw.com/)
- Visual Studio Code or IntelliJ IDEA as Integrated Development Environment (IDE)
- Tanzu Developer Tools plugin for the mentioned IDE

# Local
## Build
In order to compile the production code:
--- StartMaven
```bash
./mvnw clean compile
```
--- EndMaven
--- StartGradle
```bash
./gradlew clean compileJava
```
--- EndGradle

After that it is a good habit to compile the test classes and execute those tests to see if your application is still behaving as you would expect:
--- StartMaven
```bash
./mvnw verify
```
--- EndMaven
--- StartGradle
```bash
./gradlew compileTestJava build
```
--- EndGradle

## Start and interact
Spring Boot has its own integrated Web Server (Apache Tomcat (https://tomcat.apache.org/)).

Launch application using default profile:
--- StartMaven
```bash
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```
--- EndMaven
--- StartGradle
```bash
./gradlew bootRun
```
--- EndGradle

### Accessing home page

You can access the public page at `http://localhost:8080/` by a web browser or using `curl`:

```bash
curl -X GET -H 'Content-Type: application/html' http://localhost:8080/
```

# Deployment
## Tanzu Application Platform (TAP)
Using the `config/workload.yaml` it is possible to build, test and deploy this application onto a
Kubernetes cluster that is provisioned with Tanzu Application Platform (https://tanzu.vmware.com/application-platform).

### Tanzu CLI
Using the Tanzu CLI one could apply the workload using the local sources:
```bash
tanzu apps workload apply \
  --file config/workload.yaml \
  --namespace <namespace> --source-image <image-registry> \
  --local-path . \
  --yes \
  --tail
````

> Change the namespace to where you would like to deploy this workload. Also define the (private) image registry you
are allowed to push the source-image, like: `docker.io/username/repository`.

### Visual Studio Code Tanzu Plugin
When developing locally but would like to deploy the local code to the cluster, the Tanzu Plugin could help.
By using `Tanzu: Apply` on the `workload.yaml` it will create the Workload resource with the local source (pushed to an image registry) as
starting point.

# How to proceed from here?
Having the application locally running and deployed to a cluster you could add your domain logic, related persistence and new Spring MVC controllers.

Some tips:
- You can add images, additional CSS, etc to `src/main/resources/static` folder. It will be served by Spring Boot under `/static`. Those resources can be referenced to by Thymeleaf `@` character.
- In order to add a new page, create a new Controller, method and .html file in `src/main/resource/template` folder.
